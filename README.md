# pub-lish
Human interface project




Need to keep static files such as images and the CSS stylesheet in the static folder in order for Flask to render it

Templates store all of the html pages

Publish.py is the backend

To use on your machine 
    pip install Flask
    pip3 install mongita
    python create_db.py
    flask --app publish run
